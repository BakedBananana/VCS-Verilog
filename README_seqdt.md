101 Sequence Detector

Design a 101 sequence detector  with 1-bit input (x) and 1-bit  output (z).  Signal x is a serial input that is provided based on clock clk.   The detector sets output z  to one for one clock cycle (clk) when it detects  a “101” sequence at input x.   The detector has an asynchronous reset (rst) that clears output z. 

On the Due date you need to provide:

A Mealy or Moore FSM for the detector (20 points)
DUT in Behavioral Verilog.  (40 points)
Testbench in behavioral Verilog.  (30 points)
Simulation Log (10 points)
